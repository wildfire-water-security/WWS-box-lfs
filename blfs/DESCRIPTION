Description: Provides tools to manage large files in GitHub repositories by storing 
  them externally on Box. Uses Git LFS-style pointer files to track large files without 
  exceeding GitHub storage limits. Designed for projects with institutional Box storage, 
  such as the Wildfire and Water Security project, to streamline file tracking while 
  maintaining Git version control.
