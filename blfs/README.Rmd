# Box Large File Storage

`blfs` (Box Large File Storage) is an R package designed to simplify working with large files in GitHub repositories. By default, GitHub does not support uploading files larger than 100 MB. While Git LFS extends this limit to 2 GB, it has its own limitations—storage is capped for free accounts, and even deleted files remain permanently tied to the repository’s history. Fully removing them often requires recreating the repository, which means losing commit history.

For the Wildfire and Water Security (WWS) project, we have access to unlimited storage on Box within the shared directory. `blfs` allows us to leverage this storage while retaining the version control and collaboration benefits of Git and GitHub.

Like Git LFS, `blfs` uses lightweight **pointer files** to track large files. These `.boxtracker` files are version-controlled in GitHub and contain metadata that points to the actual file stored in Box.

Due to current organizational limitations, full automation of syncing between GitHub, the local repository, and Box isn't possible. However, this package provides tools to make the process as streamlined and user-friendly as possible.

## Installation

You can install the development version of blfs from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wildfire-water-security/WWS-box-lfs", subdir="blfs")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(blfs)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
